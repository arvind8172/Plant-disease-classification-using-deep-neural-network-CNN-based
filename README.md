Plant disease classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for 
deep learning is an advanced technique for identifying and categorizing diseases that affect plants. 
By employing artificial intelligence and image recognition, 
this method has the capability to improve agricultural practices and boost crop yields substantially.
This technology can help farmers detect diseases early on, allowing for prompt treatment and preventing the spread of infections. 
Additionally, it can assist in reducing the use of pesticides by targeting treatments only where they are needed, 
leading to cost savings and environmental benefits. Overall, plant disease classification using CNNs 
holds great potential for revolutionizing the way we approach crop management and ensuring food security for the future.
